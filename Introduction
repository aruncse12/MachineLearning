Machine Learning:
  - Making a Machine to learn from data given to it
  - Machine will be given a lot of set of data
  - M will act upon it
  - When a Question is given M will take the question and check the data it have and give an optimal result according to the data

AI & ML
  - Both are not the same
  - AI is very wide area where for each action user has to write code for e.g. in TicTacToe algorithm has to cover all possibilites
    which will be played by the opposite player
  - ML will just work on the data and give a result. No need to be very specific for each step
  
ML Integral parts
  - Data
  - Algorithms
  
Algorithms
  - Lot of Algorithms for each and every purpose
  - Linear Regression
    - Based on different dots an optinal line will be drawn in the graph and the question will be mapped to points in the graphs
      For e.g. home prises
  - Polynominal Regression
    - Kind of curved Linear Regression
  - Gradient Desent
    - Seems to be the modified version of Linear regression
  - Navie Bayes Algorithm
    - Works on the probability of each factores
      For e.g. detecting spam mails based on word "cheep", "no title", "more number of links"
  - Decision Tree
    - Works on the sets of questions and answers for them in a tree manner
    - Binary Tree
    - For e.g. Recommended Apps
