Machine Learning:
  - Making a Machine to learn from data given to it
  - Machine will be given a lot of set of data
  - M will act upon it
  - When a Question is given M will take the question and check the data it have and give an optimal result according to the data

AI & ML
  - Both are not the same
  - AI is very wide area where for each action user has to write code for e.g. in TicTacToe algorithm has to cover all possibilites
    which will be played by the opposite player
  - ML will just work on the data and give a result. No need to be very specific for each step
  
ML Integral parts
  - Data
  - Algorithms
  
Algorithms
  - Lot of Algorithms for each and every purpose
  - Linear Regression
    - Based on different dots an optinal line will be drawn in the graph and the question will be mapped to points in the graphs
      For e.g. home prises
  - Polynominal Regression
    - Kind of curved Linear Regression
  - Gradient Desent
    - Seems to be the modified version of Linear regression
    - Or used to find the line in all forms of Regression by farming the best positions for lines
  - Navie Bayes Algorithm
    - Works on the probability of each factores
      For e.g. detecting spam mails based on word "cheep", "no title", "more number of links"
  - Decision Tree
    - Works on the sets of questions and answers for them in a tree manner
    - Binary Tree
    - For e.g. Recommended Apps
  - Logistics Regression
    - Works on the set of varaibles to find final result of given data
    - For e.g. acceptence in university based on passed tests and grades of each test
    - Looks similar to Linear Regression
    - But it is different because here the line is formed by number of dots from one set which are in another set which is the error
  - Nueral Networks
    - Just as Logistic Regression but with more number of lines and circels
    - Lines should be placed so that they are always at average distance from both set of data
  - Support Vector Machine Kernal Trick
    - Used to make two lines which are closer to their own set of data and then find the average
  - K-Means Clustering
    - Start with Random Places
    - Move the place to center of the cluster
    - Move the items in the cluster to the place which are closer to it
    - Again move the place to center of cluster
    - repeat
    - Pizza hut problem
  - Heirarchical Clustering
    - Group two houses which are close to each other
    - Repeat untill you cannot group any further because maximum distance will be reached at one point
    - Pizza hut problem
